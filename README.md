# Dungeons & Dragons 5E Initiative Tracker
The initiative tracker is an app designed to make managing encounters and initiative in DnD 5e as easy and clear as possible. The Tracker automatically stores character/monster data and sorts based on initiative.

The tracker is also connected to the DnD 5e API to easily add monsters. The app pulls in a complete monster list and automatically populates ability scores, actions, special abilities and any other stats.
